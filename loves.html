            <h5>No Thai</h5>
            <p>No Thai is a Thai restaurant that currently has 7 different location choices.
                It is very popular among University of Michigan students, inlcuding me. It is 
                quick and easy but delicious! There is often enough for leftovers!

                <p>Pizza House is another favorite of University of Michigan students. It is located on
                    Church Street and is close to both campus buildings and off campus housing. While,
                    the name sounds like the only option is pizza, that is far from true. One of the most popular
                    things to order is their feta bread.

                    <p>Bricktops is located in Saint Louis, MO. It is a bit more fancy than the other
                        two, but still just as delicious. It has typical American food and has a vast
                        menu of appetizers, main courses and dessert options.

                    <h5>Cane's</h5>
                    <p>100% of survey participants voted Cane's as the #1 chicken restaurant in the world. The survey was only given to 
                        me, but regardless, Cane's won! Cane's offers chicken strips with their famous Cane's sauce. I have calculated
                        the amount of sauces you will need to order per chicken strip and you will need one less sauce than you have chicken.
                        The sauce can also be used to dip their spectacular fries in. Don't worry, I did not forget their Texas toast,
                        that is just the right amount of buttery!

                            range from a quesadilla to a burrito, but the best option is their bowls. These bowls can be topped with
                            rice, a choice of meat, beans, salsas, vegetables and more. Their chips and queso is the best way to top 
                            off a meal.

                                Their soda fountain drinks somehow make the soda itself taste better.
