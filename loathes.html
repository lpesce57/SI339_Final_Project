            <h5>Cottage Inn</h5>
            <p>Do you prefer bad pizza or bad pasta? With Cottage Inn, you actually do not have to choose because they have both! 
                I have never left Cottage Inn and wished for more. Leftovers, something that is usually exciting, become a burden.
                Now, not only did I pay to have their food in the restaurant, but I get the pleasure of having the worse
                version the next day!

                    but seeting as I do not, it is one of my least favorite restaurants. Ruining pizza is so easy and they were
                    extremely successful with that when they created a calzone. Not only is it not tasty, it is irritating to eat,
                    making it even worse.

                    <p>Brio wrote its menu with the goal of improving the amount of time people spend reading because I have to
                        read the menu so many times to pick which option sounds the least inedible. Having so many bad options 
                        is almost impressive. You would think there would be at least something I have tried but you would be incorrect.
                        Any menu option that sounds appealing is soon ruined by the way it was cooked. Who knew meat that was cooked on medium
                        could be so tough to eat? Brio sure did!

                    <p>Dunkin Donuts is saved by several of their donut flavors. Besides the few appealing ones, there is a large variety of drinks.
                        Do not get excited though, none of them are good. While I do not like coffee, theirs is worse than the average coffee. If you
                        want to explore the other options, I wouldn't. They are usually out of at least your first three choices, so make sure to have a 
                        backup order!

                        <p> Pizza is literally in the name but their pizza is still awful. It is the perfect thing to share with a lot
                            of friends so you have to have less slices. This is probably some of the worst pizza I have ever had. 
                            I would honestly rather enjoy burnt pizza from elsewhere than have Pizza Hut's best pizza. Don't worry,
                            they have bread sticks though! They are still bad but at least they might mask the lingering taste 
                            the pizza is guarenteed to leave.

                                However, each time I have eaten there I have pictured how much better each item would taste if I 
                                ordered it from somewhere else. It makes my next Cane's trip even better because Cane's just has so much

                <p>Despite having the setting where it will not be needed for a week, I still am irritated by it when the week is over.
                    The weeks are always timed out perfectly to expire right as I am somewhere I cannot be on my phone. My favorite part of small discussions
                    is when I get the pleasure of trying to do Duo Push as the instructor is teaching. It gives the impression that I am not activley listening
                    or paying attention. However, all I am trying to do is log into Canvas to pull up the in class activity we are trying to do.

                    <p>Why download a bus app with more features, that always loads and is always accurate when you could use UM Magic Bus?
                        After discovering the M Bus app, I never looked back. UM Magic bus is probably the app I have deleted and redownloaded the most.
                        After awhile of being downloaded, it randomly decides it does not want any of its features to work. Don't get excited by the word "features"
                        being plural, there aren't many. It is able to give you an inaccurate time the bus will arrive,the ability to select a certain stop if you know
                        the exact route or stop you want to know about and plenty of other difficult to navigate features.

                        <p>Loving Homescapes and wanting another version of it? Don't bother wasting your time with its sister app, Gardenscapes.
                            Gardenscapes is Homescapes except instead of desiging a house, you design a garden. Already was less interesting to me,
                            but I assumed the challenges, levels and other aspects would make up for it, but I was wrong. For an app that was designed by
                            the same company who created Homescapes, you would assume it would maintain the same quality, but you would be mistaken. Not only
                            did it remove many of my favorite aspects of the game, such as the rainbow ball power-ups, but the game-play quality is much lower.
